Once upon a time there was a Hare and a Tortoise. ‘Look at me!’ said the Hare to the other animals. ‘Just look how fast I can run.’
The Hare ran across a field as fast
as he could. All the animals agreed
that yes the Hare was very fast.
The Hare ran back.
‘See,’ he shouted. ‘I’m not even out
of breath.’
‘Yeah, that was fast,’ said a Fox.
‘So who wants a race?’ said the
Hare. ‘Anybody think they could
beat me?’
None of the animals spoke.
‘See,’ said the Hare. ‘You’re all too
scared to even try.’
‘I’ll have a go,’ said the Tortoise.
The Hare laughed. ‘You? The slowest creature in the whole world?
I’m not wasting my time racing a
Tortoise.’
