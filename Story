Once upon a time there was a Hare and a Tortoise. ‘Look at me!’ said the Hare to the other animals. ‘Just look how fast I can run.’
The Hare ran across a field as fast
as he could. All the animals agreed
that yes the Hare was very fast.
The Hare ran back.
‘See,’ he shouted. ‘I’m not even out
of breath.’
‘Yeah, that was fast,’ said a Fox.
‘So who wants a race?’ said the
Hare. ‘Anybody think they could
beat me?’
None of the animals spoke.
‘See,’ said the Hare. ‘You’re all too
scared to even try.’
‘I’ll have a go,’ said the Tortoise.
The Hare laughed. ‘You? The slowest creature in the whole world?
I’m not wasting my time racing a
Tortoise.’
‘What’s the matter?’ said the
Tortoise. ‘Scared I might beat you?’
Some of the animals laughed at
that so the Hare said, ‘Alright then,
Tortoise. Let’s have a race...right
now...then we’ll see who’s laughing.’
‘Not today,’ said the Tortoise. ‘We’ll
race next week. Got to do a bit of
training first.’
Next morning the animals watched
the Tortoise do his ‘training’. First
he did some gentle stretching exercises to warm himself up...
...and then he started to run.
‘Has he started running yet?’ asked
the Fox.
‘Hard to tell with Tortoises,’ said the
Badger. ‘He’s definitely moving.’
‘Is he?’ said the Fox.
‘Tortoise, are you sure about this?’
said the Crow. ‘I mean the Hare IS
very fast and you…well…’
